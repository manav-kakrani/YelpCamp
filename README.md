# YelpCamp
I have developed a comprehensive website for Yelp-like campground reviews across the U.S. The site features both front end and back end, enabling users to log in, create campgrounds, and post reviews. Each campground is accurately placed on a map using its longitude and latitude, offering an interactive and informative experience for campers.
